ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Zoe. 

- ðŸ‘€  Going into my third year of data/analytics. Currently a Senior Data Analyst at The Home Depot with an interest in data engineering.
- I transitioned into data in 2022 working with HR data and now am working in Home Services data at The Home Depot.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently working on data quality issues, scaling, and refactoring/remediation. I work in Jenkins pipelines and CI/CD, scaling data, and removing data silos. I read a lot about fundamentals of data engineering -- schema, warehousing, normalization.
-  In my off time, I spend time with my kids, husband, and dog. In that order.
